C Communicate the employer's philosophy and expectations. A good orientation program sets the tone for the new hire's experience with the company. It answers basic questions for new employees and helps them feel welcome and comfortable in their new surroundings. It often involves giving tours to fam iliarize the employees with the facilities, completing the required paperwork, distributing employee handbooks, and introducing them to their new colleagues. A very important aspect of orientation is to communicate the employer's philosophy and behavioral expectations so the employee can adapt accordingly. The purpose of the orientation session is not to go over specific financial goals. Job qualifications are verified during the interview process. Salaries are negotiated after the employer extends the job offer and before the candidate (new employee) accepts the offer. SOURCE: HR:360 Orient new employees SOURCE: Wroblewski, M.T.

Difficult customers come in all shapes and sizes. They are of all ages, all economic levels, and may be either male or female. They are difficult to distinguish from other customers except that they have problems that make it hard to work with them. SOURCE: CR:009 Handle difficult customers SOURCE: LAP-CR-009-Making Mad Glad (Handling Difficult Customers) 2.A Economic growth. People generally view a rising stock market as a signal that the economy is strong. Therefore, they have confidence and are more likely to spend their money. This, in turn, causes the economy to grow. The rising of the stock market does not typically lead to recession, fewer loans, or deflation. SOURCE: FI:574 Describe the relationship between economic conditions and financial markets SOURCE: Basu, C. (2019, March 6). What is a stock and how do stocks affect the economy? Retrieved August 8, 2023, from https://finance.zacks.com/stock-stocks-affect-economy-2233.html 3.A Overconfidence. Several things can cause business professionals to make poor, unethical decisions. Overconfidence is one factor that can affect a person's ability to make the right decision. Overconfident executives such as Jordan are often so sure of themselves that they can't see the risks involved in making one decision versus another, even when their colleagues warn them of possible neg ative consequences of their actions. Incrementalism is the diminishing of ethical values over time. Self-interest involves looking out for your own well-being, rather than making the ethical, right choice for the company and its employees. Framing is a tendency to respond to situations based on how those situations are posed or viewed. SOURCE: FI:355 Discuss the role of ethics in finance SOURCE: LAP-FI-355-Money Morals (The Role of Ethics in Finance) 4.D Negative. The law of diminishing returns states that if all the factors of production remain the same except one, additions to the one variable factor will eventually decrease the level of productivity. If a business adds too many workers, the level of productivity will decrea se and may even become negative if those workers do not have sufficient resources to function properly. A business with too many workers may end up spending more money to produce products than the products generate in income. At that point, the marginal pr oduct turns negative. The addition of too many workers does not cause the marginal product to turn upward or positive. Workers are a variable factor in production over which a business has control.

Retrieved August 10, 2023, from https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdi minishingmarginalreturn.asp 5.C Examining the relevant costs of advertising options. Managerial accountants can use techniques such as relevant cost analysis to assist marketers in making decisions regarding advertising options. They can determine which will have the lowest and highest costs. Determining whether to buy or make a component is not necessarily a marketing decision. Developing a target market analysis would generally not be a task for a managerial accountant. Creating a budget for hiring increases is not directly related to marketing products.

C Your role in your community. Your personal vision should address the impact you hope to have in your community through the various roles that you will have in your life-employee, citizen, mother, father, sister, brother, etc. New Year's resolutions are usually specific goals that individuals hope to achieve-therefore, they are too short-term to be included in a personal vision. Your vision should not address your t o-do list or your academic goals, either-both are too specific and short-term to be included in your vision.
